##  CommitPool Single Player Smart Contract repository

[CommitPool](http://commitpool.com/) helps people meet their personal goals by holding themselves accountable. CommitPool users stake money to credibly commit to meeting their goals, and lose their stake when they donâ€™t.

Our MVP focuses on a single goal type for individuals, hence the Single Player mode.

## Getting started

Currently Ganache and Node 14 are not playing well together. To get started:

1. Use node 12 (using yarn is recommended)
2. ```yarn install```
3. ```yarn build```
4. ```yarn test``` (to verify the build)

Note: [Hardhat guide](https://hardhat.org/guides/vscode-tests.html) on running test in VSCode

#### Deploying to local node
Hardhat

1. Use node 12 (using yarn is recommended)
2. ```yarn hardhat node```
3. In second terminal```yarn hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.ts  ```

Hardhat & Ganache

1. Use node 12 (using yarn is recommended)
2. Start Ganache on port 8545
3. In second terminal```yarn hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.ts  ```

### Contract deployment
```yarn hardhat run --network [NETWORK NAME DECLARED IN CONFIG] scripts/deploy.ts  ```

### Contract verification

``` yarn hardhat --network rinkeby verify --constructor-args scripts/arguments.js 0x24A2D8772521A9fa2f85d7024e020e7821C23c97 ```

#### Interacting with the contract using Hardhat
After deploying to a local node
1. ```yarn hardhat console --network localhost     ```
2. ```const CommitPool = await ethers.getContractFactory("SinglePlayerCommit")```
3. ```const commitPool = await CommitPool.attach("<<CONTRACT ADDRESS FROM DEPLOYMENT>>")```

Example for interacting:
```await commitPool.withdraw(1000)```
## Features
[Technical documentation](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVrBwsQ67RE9CVzyQRvDucK4LrjgB7tkAserztyBDNfJi)
#### Creation of Commitment

A commitment consists of an ```activity```, a ```goalValue``` for given activity, a ```startTime```, and ```stake```. We will automagically set the ```endTime``` 7 days after the startdate.

#### Management of Activities

An activity consists of a ```name``` and the ```oracle``` address. Activities can be enabled by setting it to ```allowed```.

#### Execution of commitment settlement

The contract can be called to process the commitment based on the address of the committer. A check on time and completion determines whether the stake is returned to the committer.
